## Purpose
This HomeLab or home server allows creative freedom and learning opportunities while creating functional services.

## Mission
The creative freedom in this project is unlimited and can be simple or complex. It allows me to create what I want, how I want, and where I want. 

Learning opportunities are incorperated in every step. As a Cybersecurity undergrad, every aspect of the HomeLab will directly improve my personal knowledge base.

Finally, functional services, like Plex, Twingate (VPN), Home Assistant (Remote access and IoT), and file sharing all benifit my style of living and my future. It also improves QOL for myself and my family.

## Values
I am creating this with the intent to learn. No malicious activity will be conducted.
